# Qadence

*Qadence* is a Python package that provides a simple interface to build _**digital-analog quantum
programs**_ with tunable interaction defined on _**arbitrary qubit register layouts**_.

## Feature highlights

* A [block-based system](tutorials/getting_started.md) for composing _**complex digital-analog
  programs**_ in a flexible and extensible manner. Heavily inspired by
  [`Yao.jl`](https://github.com/QuantumBFS/Yao.jl) and functional programming concepts.

* A [simple interface](digital_analog_qc/analog-basics.md) to work with _**interacting qubit systems**_
  using [arbitrary qubit registers](tutorials/register.md).

* Intuitive, [expression-based system](tutorials/parameters.md) built on top of `sympy` to construct
  _**parametric quantum programs**_.

* [Higher-order generalized parameter shift](link to psr tutorial) rules for _**differentiating
  arbitrary quantum operations**_ on real hardware.

* Out-of-the-box automatic differentiability of quantum programs using [https://pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org)

* `QuantumModel`s to make `QuantumCircuit`s differentiable and runnable on a variety of different
  backends like state vector simulators, tensor network emulators and real devices.

## Installation guide

Qadence can be install with `pip` as follows:

```bash
pip install qadence[pulser,visualization]
```

The default backend for qadence is [`pyqtorch`](https://github.com/pasqal-io/pyqtorch) (a
differentiable state vector simulator).  You can install one or all of the following additional
backends and the circuit visualization library using the following extras:

* `braket`: install the Amazon Braket quantum backend
* `emu-c`: install the Pasqal circuit tensor network emulator EMU-C
* `pulser`: install the [Pulser](https://github.com/pasqal-io/Pulser) backend. Pulser is a framework
  for composing, simulating and executing pulse sequences for neutral-atom quantum devices.
* `visualization`: install the library necessary to visualize quantum circuits.

**NOTE**: In order to correctly install the "visualization" extra, you need to have `graphviz` installed
in your system. This depends on the operating system you are using:

```bash
# on Ubuntu
sudo apt install graphviz

# on MacOS
brew install graphviz

# via conda
conda install python-graphviz
```
