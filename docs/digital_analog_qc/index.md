# Digital-Analog Quantum Computation

_**Digital-analog quantum computation**_ (DAQC) is a universal quantum computing
paradigm[^1], based on two primary computations:

- Fast single-qubit operations (digital).
- Multi-partite entangling operations acting on all qubits (analog).

A promising quantum computing platform for the implementation of the DAQC paradigm is neutral-atoms,
where both these computations are realizable.

## Digital-analog emulation

Qadence simplifies the execution of DAQC programs on either emulated or real devices
by providing a simplified interface for customizing interactions and interfacing
with pulse-level programming in `Pulser`[^3].

## Digital-analog transformation

Furthermore, the essence of digital-analog computation is the ability to represent any
analog operation, _i.e._ any arbitrary Hamiltonian, using an
auxiliary device-amenable Hamiltonian, such as the ubiquitous Ising model[^2].
This is at the core of the DAQC implementation in Qadence.

## Execution on Rydberg atom arrays with restriced addressability

Finally, Qadence offers some convenience constructors and interfaces to execute
programs compatible with a DAQC flavor featuring only a restricted access
to individual qubit addressability with always-on interaction. This regime is common
in currently available neutral atom quantum computers.
