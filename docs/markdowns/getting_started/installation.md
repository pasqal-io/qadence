Qadence can be installed from PyPI with `pip` as follows:

```bash
pip install qadence
```

By default, this will also install [PyQTorch](https://github.com/pasqal-io/pyqtorch), a differentiable state vector simulator which serves as the main numerical backend for Qadence.

It is possible to install additional backends and the circuit visualization library using the following extras:

* `visualization`: to display quantum circuits.
* `pulser`: the [Pulser](https://github.com/pasqal-io/Pulser) backend for composing, simulating and executing pulse sequences for neutral-atom quantum devices (in development).

To install other backends or the visualization tool, please use:

```bash
pip install "qadence[pulser, visualization]"
```

!!! note
    In order to correctly install the `visualization` extra, the `graphviz` package needs to be installed
    in your system:

    ```bash
    # on Ubuntu
    sudo apt install graphviz

    # on MacOS
    brew install graphviz

    # via conda
    conda install python-graphviz
    ```

## Install from source

We recommend to use the [`hatch`](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) environment manager to install `qadence` from source:

```bash
python -m pip install hatch

# get into a shell with all the dependencies
python -m hatch shell

# run a command within the virtual environment with all the dependencies
python -m hatch run python my_script.py
```

!!! warning
    `hatch` will not combine nicely with other environment managers such Conda. If you want to use Conda,
    install it from source using `pip`:

    ```bash
    # within the Conda environment
    python -m pip install -e .
    ```
