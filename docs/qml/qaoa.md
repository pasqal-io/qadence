In this tutorial, we show how to solve the maximum cut (MaxCut) combinatorial
optimization problem on a graph using the Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA[^1]), introduced in 2014. This showcases the flexibility of
Qadence for implementing variational algorithms without classical input
data.

Given an arbitrary graph, the MaxCut problem consists in finding a cut
partitioning the nodes into two sets, such that the number edges that are the
cut is maximized. This is a very common combinatorial problem, the interested
reader can refer to this introduction.
Let's first generate a random graph using the `networkx` library.

```python exec="on" source="material-block" html="1" session="qaoa"
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# ensure reproducibility
seed = 10
np.random.seed(seed)

n_nodes = 8
graph = nx.gnp_random_graph(n_nodes, 0.5)

plt.clf() # markdown-exec: hide
nx.draw(graph)
from docs import docsutils # markdown-exec: hide
print(docsutils.fig_to_html(plt.gcf())) # markdown-exec: hide
```

The goal of the MaxCut algorithm is to maximize the following cost function:

$$
\mathcal{C}(p) = \sum_{\alpha}^m \mathcal{C}_{\alpha}(p)
$$

where $p$ is the given partition of the graph, $\alpha$ is an index over the edges and $\mathcal{C}_{\alpha}(p)$ is written such that if the nodes connected by the $\alpha$ edge are in the same set, it returns $0$, otherwise it returns $1$.

## The QAOA quantum circuit

Let's see how to solve this problem using a parametrized quantum circuit. The
QAOA algorithm requires a circuit with two main components:

* the cost component is a circuit generated by a diagonal Hamiltonian which
  encodes the cost function described above into a quantum circuit.
* the mixing component is a simple set of single qubit rotations with adjustable
  angles which are tuned during the classical optimization loop

First, construct the generators associated with the edges of the given graph. These
will be used both in the definition of the loss function of our problem and in
constructing the quantum circuit.

```python exec="on" source="material-block" session="qaoa"
from qadence import kron, Z

zz_ops = [kron(Z(edge[0]), Z(edge[1])) for edge in graph.edges()]
```

Let's now define the QAOA quantum circuits with the cost and mixing components.
```python exec="on" source="material-block" html="1" session="qaoa"
from qadence import Zero, I, HamEvo, tag, chain, QuantumCircuit, RX

n_qubits = graph.number_of_nodes()
n_layers = 2

cost_ham = Zero()
for op in zz_ops:
    cost_ham += 0.5 * op
cost_ham = 0.5 * kron(I(i) for i in range(n_qubits)) - cost_ham

layers = []
for layer in range(n_layers):

    # cost layer with digital decomposition
    cost_layer = HamEvo(cost_ham, f"g{layer}").digital_decomposition()
    cost_layer = tag(cost_layer, "cost")

    # mixing layer with single qubit rotations
    mixing_layer = kron(RX(i, f"b{layer}{i}") for i in range(n_qubits))
    mixing_layer = tag(mixing_layer, "mixing")

    # putting all together in a single ChainBlock
    layers.append(chain(cost_layer, mixing_layer))

final_b = chain(*layers)

circuit = QuantumCircuit(n_qubits, final_b)
from qadence.draw import html_string # markdown-exec: hide
print(html_string(circuit)) # markdown-exec: hide
```
Here we used the `digital_decomposition()` method provided by Qadence for
obtaining the set of gates corresponding to the Hamiltonian evolution operation
in the cost layer.

## Train the QAOA circuit to solve MaxCut

Now that we have the circuit, we can create the associated Qadence `QuantumModel`
and train it using standard gradient based optimization. Notice that we give the
full list of edge generators since the loss function to be minimized reads:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \sum_{i,j}^{N_{\mathcal{E}}} \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \langle \psi | \sigma_i^z \sigma_j^z | \psi \rangle \right)
$$

where $\psi(\beta, \gamma)$ is the wavefunction obtained by propagating the QAQA
quantum circuit and the sum runs over the edges of the graph $N_{\mathcal{E}}$.

```python exec="on" source="material-block" result="json" session="qaoa"
import torch
from qadence import QuantumModel

model = QuantumModel(circuit, backend="pyqtorch", observable=zz_ops, diff_mode='gpsr')

_ = torch.manual_seed(seed)

def loss_function(_model: QuantumModel):
    expval_ops = model.expectation()
    # this corresponds to the MaxCut cost by definition
    # with negative sign in front to perform maximization
    expval = 0.0
    for val in expval_ops:
        expval += 0.5 * (1 - val)
    return -1.0 * expval

# initialize the parameters to random values
model.reset_vparams(torch.rand(model.num_vparams))
initial_loss = loss_function(model)
print(f"Initial loss: {initial_loss}")

# train the model
n_epochs = 100
lr = 1.0

optimizer = torch.optim.Adagrad(model.parameters(), lr=lr)

for i in range(n_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss = loss_function(model)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    if (i+1) % (n_epochs // 10) == 0:
        print(f"MaxCut cost at iteration {i+1}: {-loss.item()}")
```
## Results

Given the optimized model, we need now to sample the resulting quantum state to
recover the bitstring with the highest probability which corresponds to the maximum
cut of the graph.
```python exec="on" source="material-block" html="1" session="qaoa"
samples = model.sample(n_shots=100)[0]
most_frequent = max(samples, key=samples.get)

print(f"Most frequently sampled bitstring corresponding to the maximum cut: {most_frequent}")

# let's now draw the cut obtained with the QAOA procedure
colors = []
labels = {}
for node, b in zip(graph.nodes(), most_frequent):
    colors.append("green") if int(b) == 0 else colors.append("red")
    labels[node] = "A" if int(b) == 0 else "B"

plt.clf() # markdown-exec: hide
nx.draw_networkx(graph, node_color=colors, with_labels=True, labels=labels)
from docs import docsutils # markdown-exec: hide
print(docsutils.fig_to_html(plt.gcf())) # markdown-exec: hide
```
