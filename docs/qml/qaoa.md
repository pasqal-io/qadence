This tutorial shows how to solve the maximum cut (MaxCut) combinatorial
optimization problem on a graph using the Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA), first introduced by Farhi *et al.* in 2014 [^1].

Given an arbitrary graph, the MaxCut problem consists in finding a
graph [*cut*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_(graph_theory)) which partitions
the nodes into two disjoint sets, such that the number of edges in the
cut is maximized. This is a very common combinatorial optimization problem which is
computationally hard.

The graph used for this tutorial is a randomly generated using the `networkx` library with
a $0.5$ probability of having an edge between two arbitrary nodes.

```python exec="on" source="material-block" html="1" session="qaoa"
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# ensure reproducibility
seed = 10
np.random.seed(seed)

n_nodes = 8
edge_prob = 0.5
graph = nx.gnp_random_graph(n_nodes, edge_prob)

plt.clf() # markdown-exec: hide
nx.draw(graph)
from docs import docsutils # markdown-exec: hide
print(docsutils.fig_to_html(plt.gcf())) # markdown-exec: hide
```

The goal of the MaxCut algorithm is to maximize the following cost function:

$$
\mathcal{C}(p) = \sum_{\alpha}^m \mathcal{C}_{\alpha}(p)
$$

where $p$ is the given partition of the graph, $\alpha$ is an index over the edges and $\mathcal{C}_{\alpha}(p)$ is written
such that if the nodes connected by the $\alpha$ edge are in the same set, it returns $0$, otherwise it returns $1$.

## The QAOA quantum circuit

This problem can be solved by using a parametrized quantum circuit with the QAOA algorithm. This
requires a circuit with two main components:

* the **cost component**: a circuit generated by a diagonal Hamiltonian which
  encodes the cost function described above into a quantum circuit.
* the **mixing component**: a simple set of single-qubit rotations with adjustable
  angles which are tuned during the classical optimization loop to minimize the cost

Below, the QAOA quantum circuit with the cost and mixing components is defined using
`qadence` operations. The cost component of each layer of the circuit is decomposed
into digital single and two-qubits operations via the `.digital_decomposition()` method.
The decomposition is exact since the Hamiltonian generator is diagonal.

```python exec="on" source="material-block" result="json" session="qaoa"
from qadence import Zero, I, HamEvo, tag, kron, chain, QuantumCircuit, RX, Z

# generators associated with the edges of the given graph
zz_ops = [kron(Z(edge[0]), Z(edge[1])) for edge in graph.edges()]

n_qubits = graph.number_of_nodes()
n_layers = 2

cost_ham = Zero()
for op in zz_ops:
    cost_ham += 0.5 * op
cost_ham = 0.5 * kron(I(i) for i in range(n_qubits)) - cost_ham

layers = []
for layer in range(n_layers):

    # cost layer with digital decomposition
    cost_layer = HamEvo(cost_ham, f"g{layer}").digital_decomposition()
    cost_layer = tag(cost_layer, "cost")

    # mixing layer with single qubit rotations
    mixing_layer = kron(RX(i, f"b{layer}{i}") for i in range(n_qubits))
    mixing_layer = tag(mixing_layer, "mixing")

    # putting all together in a single ChainBlock
    layers.append(chain(cost_layer, mixing_layer))

final_b = chain(*layers)

circuit = QuantumCircuit(n_qubits, final_b)
from qadence.draw import html_string # markdown-exec: hide
print(html_string(circuit)) # markdown-exec: hide
```

## Train the QAOA circuit to solve MaxCut

Given the QAOA circuit above, one can construct the associated Qadence `QuantumModel`
and train it using standard gradient based optimization.

The loss function to be minimized reads:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \sum_{i,j}^{N_{\mathcal{E}}} \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \langle \psi | \sigma_i^z \sigma_j^z | \psi \rangle \right)
$$

where $\psi(\beta, \gamma)$ is the wavefunction obtained by propagating the QAQA
quantum circuit and the sum runs over the edges of the graph $N_{\mathcal{E}}$.

```python exec="on" source="material-block" result="json" session="qaoa"
import torch
from qadence import QuantumModel

torch.manual_seed(seed)


def loss_function(_model: QuantumModel):

    expval_ops = _model.expectation().squeeze()

    # this corresponds to the MaxCut cost by definition
    # with negative sign in front to perform maximization
    expval = 0.0
    for val in expval_ops:
        expval += 0.5 * (1 - val)

    return -1.0 * expval

# initialize the parameters to random values
model = QuantumModel(circuit, observable=zz_ops)
model.reset_vparams(torch.rand(model.num_vparams))
initial_loss = loss_function(model)
print(f"Initial loss: {initial_loss}")

# train the model
n_epochs = 100
lr = 1.0

optimizer = torch.optim.Adagrad(model.parameters(), lr=lr)

for i in range(n_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss = loss_function(model)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    if (i+1) % (n_epochs // 10) == 0:
        print(f"MaxCut cost at iteration {i+1}: {-loss.item()}")
```

Qadence offers some convenience functions to implement this training loop with advanced
logging and metrics track features. You can refer to [this](../qml/qml_tools.md) for more details.

## Results

Given the trained quantum model, one needs to sample the resulting quantum state to
recover the bitstring with the highest probability which corresponds to the maximum
cut of the graph.

```python exec="on" source="material-block" result="json" session="qaoa"
samples = model.sample(n_shots=100)[0]
most_frequent = max(samples, key=samples.get)

print(f"Most frequently sampled bitstring corresponding to the maximum cut: {most_frequent}")

# let's now draw the cut obtained with the QAOA procedure
colors = []
labels = {}
for node, b in zip(graph.nodes(), most_frequent):
    colors.append("green") if int(b) == 0 else colors.append("red")
    labels[node] = "A" if int(b) == 0 else "B"

plt.clf() # markdown-exec: hide
nx.draw_networkx(graph, node_color=colors, with_labels=True, labels=labels)
from docs import docsutils # markdown-exec: hide
print(docsutils.fig_to_html(plt.gcf())) # markdown-exec: hide
```
