These examples show how to use the backends directly. That is, how to use
qadence to define the `QuantumCircuit` but have it executed directly in backend without
using the autodiff wrapper.

Although it is straight-forward, this shouldn't be necessary for most usecases.
Please shoot us a quick message before using this approach for a project.
