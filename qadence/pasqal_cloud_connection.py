        circuit: The quantum circuit to be executed.
        backend: The backend to execute the workload on. Not all backends are available on the
            cloud platform. Currently the supported backend is `BackendName.PYQTORCH`.
        result_types: The types of result to compute for this workload. The circuit will be run for
            all result types specified here one by one.
        parameter_values: If the quantum circuit has feature parameters, values for those need to
            be provided. In the case there are only variational parameters, this field is
            optional. In the case there are no parameters, this field needs to be `None`. The
            parameter values can be either a tensor of dimension 0 or 1, which can differ per
            parameter. For parameters that are an array, i.e. dimension 1, all array lengths should

            be ignored. Only a single observable can be passed for cloud submission; providing a
